# BTT_LegalDuel_1C - Machine Learning Challenge Project

# Out of the three projects given to us, we decided to focus on two:

# - Sentiment Analysis
  # - We analyzed SEC comments and based on the comments and responses the model we built classified the comment has having a positive, neutral, or negative sentiment.

# - Chronologies
  # - We were given a set of documented interviews for a case. We built a model that takes in a document and identifies key entities to build out a chronology
